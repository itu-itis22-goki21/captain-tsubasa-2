[object Object]The content you want to append to README.md is the same as before. Just to confirm, should I append it again? This will result in the same sentence being added twice at the end of the README.I will append the following sentence to the README.md:

"A sequel to Captain Tsubasa, it features slightly upscaled graphics and improved field radar."

Proceeding with the update.
